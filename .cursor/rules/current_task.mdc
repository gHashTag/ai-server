# Current Task: Debug Robokassa User Payment Notification (Issue Persists)

**Goal:** Diagnose and fix the reason why the user is still not receiving a notification upon successful payment via Robokassa, despite previous attempts to fix it.

**Decomposition:**

1.  **Re-examine `payment.service.ts`:**
    *   Focus on the `try...catch` block around `bot.telegram.sendMessage(telegram_id.toString(), userMessage)` ([payment.service.ts](mdc:src/services/payment.service.ts)).
    *   Is the `catch` block being triggered? Check logs for `FAILED to send user notification`.
    *   Verify `telegram_id` retrieval from `paymentData`.
    *   Verify successful bot instance creation via `createBotByName`. Check logs for `Could not create bot instance`.

2.  **Detailed Log Analysis (Needs User Action):**
    *   Request the user to perform **another Robokassa test payment**.
    *   Carefully analyze the server logs (`ai-server` container) immediately after the payment for:
        *   `[PaymentSuccess] User notification sent successfully to ...`
        *   `[PaymentSuccess] FAILED to send user notification to ...` (and the associated error).
        *   `[PaymentSuccess] Could not create bot instance ...`
        *   Any other errors within the `processPayment` function context.

3.  **Investigate Potential Causes:**
    *   **Silent Send Failure:** Could `sendMessage` fail without throwing an error caught by the `try...catch`?
    *   **Incorrect ID / Bot Blocked:** Is the `telegram_id` definitely correct? Has the user potentially blocked the bot?
    *   **Bot Instance Issue:** Is the `bot` instance retrieved by `createBotByName` valid and capable of sending messages?
    *   **Environment/Configuration:** Are all necessary environment variables (like bot tokens) correctly configured in the **production/docker environment** where the test is happening?

**Next Steps:**

*   Re-read the user notification code block in [payment.service.ts](mdc:src/services/payment.service.ts).
*   Ask the user to perform a test payment and provide relevant server logs.
