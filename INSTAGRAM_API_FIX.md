# Instagram API 403 Error Fix

## Problem
The Instagram scraper was experiencing 403 authentication errors due to missing or invalid API keys.

## Root Cause
The `RAPIDAPI_INSTAGRAM_KEY` environment variable was either:
1. Not set in the production environment
2. Set to an invalid/expired API key
3. Empty or containing only whitespace

## Solution Applied
1. **Enhanced API Key Validation**: Added validation in the `InstagramAPI` constructor to check if the API key exists and is not empty.
2. **Improved Error Handling**: Added specific 403 error handling with detailed authentication debugging information.
3. **Better Logging**: Enhanced environment variable diagnostics and API configuration logging.

## Code Changes
The fix is already implemented in commit `2bc7ce9` which includes:
- API key validation in constructor at `src/inngest-functions/instagramScraper-v2.ts:87-89`
- 403 error handling at lines `191-204` and `366-382`
- Environment variable validation at lines `1334-1337`

## Deployment Requirements
1. **Set Environment Variables** in production:
   ```bash
   RAPIDAPI_INSTAGRAM_KEY=your-valid-rapidapi-key-here
   RAPIDAPI_INSTAGRAM_HOST=real-time-instagram-scraper-api1.p.rapidapi.com
   ```

2. **Verify API Key**: Make sure the RapidAPI key:
   - Is valid and active
   - Has sufficient quota/credits
   - Has permissions for Instagram data access

3. **Rebuild Application**: Run `npm run build` to ensure latest changes are compiled.

## Testing
The fix includes comprehensive error messages that will help identify:
- Missing API keys (`RAPIDAPI_INSTAGRAM_KEY environment variable is required`)
- 403 authentication issues (`Instagram API authentication failed (403)`)
- Rate limiting issues with proper retry logic

## Environment Configuration
Added Instagram API keys to `/env/.env.example`:
```
# Instagram API (RapidAPI)
RAPIDAPI_INSTAGRAM_KEY=your-rapidapi-instagram-key-here
RAPIDAPI_INSTAGRAM_HOST=real-time-instagram-scraper-api1.p.rapidapi.com
```

## Status
✅ **FIXED** - The 403 authentication error handling is now properly implemented. 
⚠️ **ACTION REQUIRED** - Set the `RAPIDAPI_INSTAGRAM_KEY` environment variable in production.
