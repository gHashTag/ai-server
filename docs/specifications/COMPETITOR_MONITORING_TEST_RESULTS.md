## 💾 Database Performance

```sql
-- Existing data verified:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM instagram_apify_reels;  -- 27 reels
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM competitor_subscriptions;  -- Ready for new subscriptions
```

**Top performing reels in system:**
1. @a24: 2,740,328 views ✅
2. @therock: 1,763,251 views ✅  
3. @therock: 459,400 views ✅

## 🚨 Known Limitations

1. **API Server**: Not running during tests (expected)
2. **Live Telegram**: Requires production environment 
3. **Apify Quotas**: Subject to Apify rate limits
4. **Environment**: Some tests require `.env` configuration

**⚠️ These are deployment considerations, not system flaws**
